# gnmvidispine

Python object-based interface to Vidispine API.  Module documentation can be found here: http://docs.multimedia.theguardian.com/vs-python/, or build your own using Doxygen.

This has currently been tested against the 2.x branch.

For more info, also see the other .md documentation in this directory.

DISCLAIMER: I am not employed by Vidispine, have no insider knowledge of it, and do not have any say in the roadmap.  Any questions about Vidispine itself should be directed to them.
